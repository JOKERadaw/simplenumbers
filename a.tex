\section*{Understanding the Mathematical Concept Behind the Fractal}

In this explanation, I'll use \( R \) to denote a real number and \( I \) to denote an imaginary number. Let's start with a basic multiplication example: if we have \( 3R \times 2R \), the result is \( 6R \).

\subsection*{Breaking Down the Multiplication}

In this idea, we break the real number \( R \) apart and think of it as \( 3 \times R \times 2 \times R \). This gives us \( 6 \times R^2 \). Now, traditionally, \( R^2 \) is just \( R \times R \), which is another real number. When you multiply two real numbers, the result is still a real number.

\subsection*{Introducing Complex Numbers}

However, things change when you introduce complex numbers. For instance, if you multiply a real number by an imaginary number, like \( 1R \times 1I \), the result becomes imaginary because \( R \times I = I \).

When you multiply two imaginary numbers, the result becomes real again. For example, \( I \times I = -1 \), which is a real number.

\subsection*{Transformation and Multiplication Matrices}

There are two key concepts here: the transformation matrix and the multiplication matrix.

\subsubsection*{Transformation Matrix}

The transformation matrix defines the rules of the system, such as:

\[
R \times R = I \quad \text{or} \quad R
\]
\[
I \times R = R \quad \text{or} \quad I
\]
\[
I \times I = R \quad \text{or} \quad i
\]
\[
R \times i = R \quad \text{or} \quad I
\]

This matrix tells us how different elements interact when multiplied. It's a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix that includes all possible multiplication transformations. These rules can adhere to the standard definitions of complex numbers or be entirely different.

\subsubsection*{Multiplication Matrix}

The multiplication matrix helps us understand what happens when you multiply different elements:

- When \( R \times R \), it could be equivalent to \( R \times R \times 1 \) or \( R \times R \times 2 \) or even \( R \times R \times -1 \).

\section*{Summary}

In summary, this concept breaks down the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers into a system governed by custom rules defined in transformation and multiplication matrices. These rules can create interesting and complex patterns, like the fractal you see in the image.
