# Understanding the Mathematical Concept Behind the Fractal

In this explanation, I'll use `R` to denote a real number and `I` to denote an imaginary number. Let's start with a basic multiplication example: if we have `3R * 2R`, the result is `6R`.

## Breaking Down the Multiplication

In this idea, we break the real number `R` apart and think of it as `3 * R * 2 * R`. This gives us `6 * R^2`. Now, traditionally, `R^2` is just `R * R`, which is another real number. When you multiply two real numbers, the result is still a real number.

## Introducing Complex Numbers

However, things change when you introduce complex numbers. For instance, if you multiply a real number by an imaginary number, like `1R * 1I`, the result becomes imaginary because `R * I = I`.

When you multiply two imaginary numbers, the result becomes real again. For example, `I * I = -1`, which is a real number.

## Transformation and Multiplication Matrices

There are two key concepts here: the transformation matrix and the multiplication matrix.

### Transformation Matrix

The transformation matrix defines the rules of the system, such as:
