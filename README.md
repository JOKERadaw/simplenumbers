# Understanding the Mathematical Concept Behind the Fractal

In this explanation, I'll use `R` to denote a real number and `I` to denote an imaginary number. Let's start with a basic multiplication example: if we have `3R * 2R`, the result is `6R`.

## Breaking Down the Multiplication

In this idea, we break the real number `R` apart and think of it as `3 * R * 2 * R`. This gives us `6 * R^2`. Now, traditionally, `R^2` is just `R * R`, which is another real number. When you multiply two real numbers, the result is still a real number.

## Introducing Complex Numbers

However, things change when you introduce complex numbers. For instance, if you multiply a real number by an imaginary number, like `1R * 1I`, the result becomes imaginary because `R * I = I`.

When you multiply two imaginary numbers, the result becomes real again. For example, `I * I = -1`, which is a real number.

## Transformation and Multiplication Matrices

There are two key concepts here: the transformation matrix and the multiplication matrix.

### Transformation Matrix

The transformation matrix defines the rules of the system, such as:

R * R = R or I
I * R = R or I
I * I = R or i
R * i = R or I
This matrix tells us how different elements interact when multiplied. It's a `2 x 2` matrix that includes all possible multiplication transformations. These rules can adhere to the standard definitions of complex numbers or be entirely different.

### Multiplication Matrix

The multiplication matrix helps us understand what happens when you multiply different elements:

- When `R * R`, it could be equivalent to `R * R * 1` or `R * R * 2` or even `R * R * -1`.

## Summary

In summary, this concept breaks down the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers into a system governed by custom rules defined in transformation and multiplication matrices. These rules can create interesting and complex patterns, like the fractal you see in the image.
