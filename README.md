Understanding the Mathematical Concept Behind the Fractal
In this explanation, I'll use 
𝑅
R to denote a real number and 
𝐼
I to denote an imaginary number. Let's start with a basic multiplication example: if we have 
3
𝑅
×
2
𝑅
3R×2R, the result is 
6
𝑅
6R.

Breaking Down the Multiplication
In this idea, we break the real number 
𝑅
R apart and think of it as 
3
×
𝑅
×
2
×
𝑅
3×R×2×R. This gives us 
6
×
𝑅
2
6×R 
2
 . Now, traditionally, 
𝑅
2
R 
2
  is just 
𝑅
×
𝑅
R×R, which is another real number. When you multiply two real numbers, the result is still a real number.

Introducing Complex Numbers
However, things change when you introduce complex numbers. For instance, if you multiply a real number by an imaginary number, like 
1
𝑅
×
1
𝐼
1R×1I, the result becomes imaginary because 
𝑅
×
𝐼
=
𝐼
R×I=I.

When you multiply two imaginary numbers, the result becomes real again. For example, 
𝐼
×
𝐼
=
−
1
I×I=−1, which is a real number.

Transformation and Multiplication Matrices
There are two key concepts here: the transformation matrix and the multiplication matrix.

Transformation Matrix
The transformation matrix defines the rules of the system, such as:

𝑅
×
𝑅
=
𝐼
R×R=I or 
𝑅
R
𝐼
×
𝑅
=
𝑅
I×R=R or 
𝐼
I
This matrix tells us how different elements interact when multiplied. It's a 
2
×
2
2×2 matrix that includes all possible multiplication transformations. These rules can adhere to the standard definitions of complex numbers or be entirely different.

Multiplication Matrix
The multiplication matrix helps us understand what happens when you multiply different elements:

When 
𝑅
×
𝑅
R×R, it could be equivalent to 
𝑅
×
𝑅
×
1
R×R×1 or 
𝑅
×
𝑅
×
2
R×R×2 or even 
𝑅
×
𝑅
×
−
1
R×R×−1.
Example Python Code
Here's an example of how you might implement these concepts in Python:
Summary
In summary, this concept breaks down the multiplication of real and imaginary numbers into a system governed by custom rules defined in transformation and multiplication matrices. These rules can create interesting and complex patterns, like the fractal you see in the image.
